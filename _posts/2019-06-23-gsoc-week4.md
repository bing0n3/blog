## Meeting Log

We didn't hold meeting this week. 

## Work Done this week

* Implemented Evolution Metrics
    * [Open Issue Age](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/issues-open-age.md): the the age of open issues
    * [Closed Issue Resolution Duration](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution/blob/master/metrics/issues-closed-resolution-duration.md): the duration of time for issues to be resolved
* Add an endpoint to fetch `repo_group_id` and `repo_id` by `owner` and `name` to adapt to new API endpoint `repo-group/:repo_group_id/repo/:repo_id` and `repo-group/:repo_group_id`

When I added this endpoint to initial `repo_gorup_id` and `repo_id` in obejct `Repo`, It casued a new problem: duplicate requests to the endpoint. It takes around 30 seconds to open `Git` Card(High latency from China to server aggravated this probelm). This is very annoying.  The cause of this problem is creating too many duplucate instances of `Repo` in card and charts implemetation. Every chart create a new `Repo` from `giturl` and also create a new request.  After discovering the cause, we can solve them more easily.  

* Explored `Vege`/`Vega-Lite`  which is a visualizations framework used in `Augur` 

### Not finished Work  

* Visulize `issue_active` using `DynamicLineChart`
  * Struggle in how to pass data into `DynamicLineChart`
  * Exploring `DynamicLineChart` Implementation

### Pull Request Created

* [chaoss/Augur#297](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/297): Initial repo_group_id and repo_id when Repo construct

* [chaoss/Augur#299](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/299):Implement evolution metrics and Optimize Chart

* [chaoss/Augur#301](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/pull/301): Optimize frontend to prevent duplicate requests



## Plans For Next Week

* Visualize metrics releated to issues and create new visulize chart if necesary
* Create a repo group object to hold all repo group endpoints
