## Meeting log

**Date**: 03/06/2019

**Summary**

* Add API endpoints for the metric implementations
* Refactor metric implementations for parameters `repo_group_id` and `repo_id` to work with new API endpoints.
* Write documentation for API endpoints.
* Create unit tests for the metrics implementations.

## Works Done this Week

* Refacored all metrics implemted last week. Now all metrics can accept `repo_id` and `repo_group_id`.
* Created API endpoints for metrics implemted. Now we can use `/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/repos/:repo_id/[metric]` or `/repo-groups/:repo_group_id/[metric]` to access.
* Wrote documentation for new endpoints.
* Created one unit test but suspended because of dataset issue.
